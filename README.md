# Hostel_management_system
MEAN stack

Through this project, I have developed a system for Hostel management which indicates that it is useful for the warden or the incharge of the hostel to manage(adding, deleting, updating) hostel workers and students if there is any change in food it can also be updated and one more specific functionality is about marking attendance for the hostel inmates.

The app_src.zip indicates that it will be an app file inside the src folder of the angular project.

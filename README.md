# Hostel_management_system
MEAN stack
Through this project, I have developed a system for Hostel management which indicates that it is useful for the warden or the incharge of the hostel to manage it like managing(adding, deleting, updating) hostel workers,students if there is any change in food it can also be updated and one more specific functionality is about marking attendance for the hostel inmates.
